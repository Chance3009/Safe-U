# Safe-U Campus Safety Platform

**By: ViCoders**  
**Track 2: Campus Management**

## Problem Statement

**The Problem:** In panic situations, students face three critical challenges:
- **Hesitation** - Don't know how to react in emergency situations
- **Unseen** - Help exists, but has wait times and accessibility windows
- **Slow Help** - Help exists, but response times are delayed

**Our Solution:** A panic-proof mobile platform that enables students to be seen in real-time, avoid danger, and guide responders straight to them within seconds.

## Overview

A comprehensive campus safety ecosystem that connects individuals, peers, and campus security through one integrated platform. With SOS alerts, friend walk, incident reporting, and safety resources, it enables prevention, rapid response, and community resilience.

This platform consists of a mobile app for students and an admin console for safety administrators.
